          <h2>User Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Job seekers often struggle to keep track of multiple job
            applications, deadlines, and follow-ups, leading to missed
            opportunities and increased stress. The lack of a centralized system
            to manage job search activities can result in disorganization and
            inefficiency. Additionally, users may find it challenging to analyze
            their job search progress and identify areas for improvement without
            visual analytics. Job Tracker addresses these issues by providing a
            comprehensive platform that streamlines job search management,
            enhances organization, and offers valuable insights through
            analytics.

            <p>
              While Job Tracker has successfully addressed many challenges faced
              by job seekers, there are several areas for potential improvement
              in future iterations. One key enhancement could be the addition of
              a mobile application to complement the web platform, providing
              users with greater flexibility and accessibility on the go.
              Integrating calendar synchronization features would also be
              beneficial, allowing users to link job application deadlines and
              follow-ups directly with their personal calendars. Furthermore,
              incorporating AI-driven job recommendations based on user
              preferences and application history could enhance the user
              experience by providing tailored job suggestions. Expanding the
              analytics capabilities to include more detailed insights and
              trends would empower users to make even more informed decisions
              about their job search strategies. Lastly, gathering continuous
              user feedback and conducting usability testing would help identify
              pain points and areas for refinement, ensuring that Job Tracker
              remains a user-centric and effective tool for job seekers.
